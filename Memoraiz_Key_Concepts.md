# Key Concepts in Memoraiz

## Company Canvas
The **Company Canvas** is a structured profile that captures the essential DNA of your organization. It serves as the "identity card" for your AI assistant, ensuring that every interaction, generated content, or strategic suggestion is aligned with your specific context.

The Canvas collects six core dimensions:
1. **Company Name**: Your official organization name.
2. **Industry**: The sector you operate in (e.g., Education, Tourism, Publishing).
3. **Description**: A brief overview of what your company does and its unique value proposition.
4. **AI Maturity Level**: Your current state of AI adoption (see below).
5. **AI Usage**: How you currently use or plan to use artificial intelligence.
6. **Goals**: The specific objectives you want to achieve with Memoraiz (e.g., automate support, centralize knowledge).

Populating the Canvas is the first step in onboarding. It allows Memoraiz to tailor its modules and agents to your needs effectively.
